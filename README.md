# 📊 Personal Finance Dashboard
**Turning financial behavior into clear, data-driven insights**

---

## 🧭 Overview

Many people earn money regularly, yet still feel confused about where their money goes.  
This typically occurs because emotions, rather than numbers, often drive financial decisions.

This project is a **Personal Finance Dashboard** built to analyze real income and expense data over multiple years, to understand financial behavior, identify spending patterns, and improve financial decision-making using data — not assumptions.

The dashboard transforms raw financial records into a clear story about:
- Spending vs saving behavior
- Net worth growth over time
- Lifestyle changes and their financial impact
- The real reasons behind financial stress
