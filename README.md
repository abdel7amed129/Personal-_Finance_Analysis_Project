# 📊 Personal Finance Dashboard
**Turning financial behavior into clear, data-driven insights**

---

## 🧭 Overview

Many people earn money regularly, yet still feel confused about where their money goes.  
This usually happens because financial decisions are driven by feelings instead of numbers.

This project is a **Personal Finance Dashboard** built to analyze real income and expense data over multiple years, to understand financial behavior, identify spending patterns, and improve financial decision-making using data — not assumptions.

The dashboard transforms raw financial records into a clear story about:
- Spending vs saving behavior
- Net worth growth over time
- Lifestyle changes and their financial impact
- The real reasons behind financial stress
